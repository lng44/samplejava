name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push to the "main" branch and when new tags are created
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
    tags: [ "*" ] # Triggers on any new tag


  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
